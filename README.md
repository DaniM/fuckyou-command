fuckyou-command
===============

The most awesome and elegant way to kill processes! Just type

fuckyou <process name> and it will kill the process along with a nice unicode char art.

Enough of jokes! It's a simple program that I wrote in less than an hour (I think I spent more time writing the Makefile than the command itself) to laugh a little. It's inefficient and ugly, but hey it does the work.


To install this wonderful command in your *nix just type

make install

and that's all! Now you can say GFYS to every running process

BTW: This one is funnier and (truth be told) better https://github.com/robotlolita/fuck-you
